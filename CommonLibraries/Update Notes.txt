Updates for the Silverlight Toolkit can be applied by using svn merge.

In the TortoiseSVN GUI, select "Merge two different trees" and enter the following URL for both "from" and "to":
https://silverlight.svn.codeplex.com/svn/Release/WindowsPhone71/

For the "from" revision, enter the last revision that was imported. (At this time, that was revision 74695.) For the "to" revision, select HEAD.

Complete the merge and this copy should be updated to the latest revision.
